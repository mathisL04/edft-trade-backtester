# edft-trade-backtester
power-gas-trade-recon:   **Automated pipeline for validating and analyzing EDF Energy power and gas trades using Snowflake and FIS Aligne, with PnL backtesting and trade quality checks.**


# ⚡📈 EDF Trade Backtesting & Validation Tool

This project is a fully automated Python-based pipeline for **backtesting**, **validating**, and **analyzing EDF Energy’s Power and Gas trades**. It connects to internal systems including **FIS Aligne** (trade log source) and **Snowflake** (internal valuation database), compares traded prices to EDFT benchmark curves, and flags unusual pricing patterns or data integrity issues. The tool also visualizes significant PnL outcomes and trade risks.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **📅 Date-Driven Execution**  
  Users input a trade date (e.g., `13JUN25`) and the tool dynamically locates the correct CSV trade files for that day. It validates format, filters out weekends, and ensures data availability before proceeding.

- **❄️ Snowflake Integration**  
  Automatically fetches historical EDFT valuation curves for Power and Gas via Snowflake SQL queries. The number of days back is dynamically computed from the trade date.

- **🏷️ Intelligent Labeling**  
  Trade delivery windows are automatically labeled with:
  - Delivery season (`WIN` / `SUM`)
  - Quarter (`Q1`, `Q2`...)
  - Month and week
  - Load shape (`Baseload`, `Peakload`, `Offpeak`)
  - Trade granularity (`SinglePeriod` vs `MULTI`)

- **📉 PnL Calculation and Risk Detection**  
  Calculates traded price, internal valuation, and compares to EDFT reference pricing:
  - Computes absolute and weighted price differences
  - Flags trades with large discrepancies (e.g., >£10,000 PnL or >£2 price delta)
  - Detects suspicious trades with `Volume == Forward Valuation` (often prompt)

- **📊 Visual Analytics**  
  - PnL scatter plots (Power and Gas)
  - Color-coded profit/loss markers
  - Annotated trade IDs and value labels
  - Legends with summary counts:
    - PnL > £10k
    - PnL > £100k
    - Profit / Loss counts
